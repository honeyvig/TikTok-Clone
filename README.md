# TikTok-Clone
Creating a full-fledged TikTok clone in Python would require integrating multiple technologies, including a front-end (UI/UX), a backend (for user authentication, videos, data management), and video processing tools. Python is not typically used for developing mobile apps like TikTok, as it's generally used more for backend development, web apps, or data processing.

However, if you're looking to develop a simple prototype of a TikTok clone that involves basic video uploading, playback, and interaction, you can use frameworks such as Flask or Django for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. You'd also need libraries for handling videos, like OpenCV or MoviePy.

Here’s a simplified approach to create a basic version (backend-focused) using Flask for serving and handling video uploads. For this code, I will assume you want a basic structure for uploading and displaying videos.
Prerequisites:

    Install necessary libraries:

pip install Flask
pip install MoviePy

Basic Flask App (Backend for TikTok Clone):

from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for
import os
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename
import moviepy.editor as mp

# Create Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Set the path for file uploads and allowed file extensions
app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = 'uploads/'
app.config['ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS'] = {'mp4', 'avi', 'mov', 'mkv'}

# Function to check allowed file extensions
def allowed_file(filename):
    return '.' in filename and filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in app.config['ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS']

# Home route - To display uploaded videos
@app.route('/')
def index():
    video_files = os.listdir(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'])
    return render_template('index.html', video_files=video_files)

# Upload video route
@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_video():
    if 'file' not in request.files:
        return redirect(request.url)
    file = request.files['file']
    
    if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
        filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
        filepath = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename)
        file.save(filepath)

        # Optional: Perform basic video editing or thumbnail creation
        clip = mp.VideoFileClip(filepath)
        clip.preview()  # Preview video

        return redirect(url_for('index'))
    else:
        return "Invalid file format", 400

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Create upload folder if it doesn't exist
    if not os.path.exists('uploads'):
        os.makedirs('uploads')
    
    # Run the Flask app
    app.run(debug=True)

HTML Template (index.html):

Create a folder named templates and inside it create an index.html file:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>TikTok Clone</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Upload and View Videos</h1>
    
    <form action="/upload" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <input type="file" name="file" accept="video/*" required>
        <button type="submit">Upload Video</button>
    </form>

    <h2>Uploaded Videos</h2>
    <ul>
        {% for video in video_files %}
            <li><video width="320" height="240" controls>
                <source src="{{ url_for('static', filename='uploads/' + video) }}" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video></li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>

Explanation:

    The Flask app has a home route (/) to display uploaded videos.
    Users can upload videos via the /upload route using a simple HTML form.
    Once uploaded, the video is saved in the uploads/ directory.
    The basic video functionality is handled with the MoviePy library, and videos are shown on the frontend using HTML <video> tags.

Running the App:

    Save the Python code in a file (e.g., app.py).
    Ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed (Flask, MoviePy).
    Create a folder named uploads in the same directory to store the uploaded videos.
    Run the Flask app using:

    python app.py

    Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser to view the application.

Next Steps:

To extend this prototype into a more TikTok-like experience, you would need to:

    Add user authentication and profiles (using Flask-login or Flask-Security).
    Create a more sophisticated frontend with CSS/JavaScript (possibly with a framework like React or Vue.js for a more dynamic interface).
    Implement video filters, effects, and other editing tools using MoviePy or OpenCV.
    Add social features like comments, likes, and sharing.
    Handle scalability and deployment (using cloud services like AWS, Heroku, or similar).

This code is a starting point and does not have the complexities of TikTok’s features, but it gives you the basic infrastructure for video uploading and viewing.
